TODO 
---------
1. Need to create setup-openldap as below 
./setup-openldap --master  to setup Master server 

2. To setup slave
./setup-openldap --slave --master=<ip-address-of-master> --config-admin=<configuration-administrator> --configpw=<configpw> --suffixrootdn=<rootdn> --suffix=<rootpw>

3. Before setup slave, we take backup just in case anything happens. 

4. We might want to add support to setup tls , This would require 

1. Either setup up a CA 
2. Or provide the certificate files as input 

Example ./setup-openldap --master --tls_cacert=<path-to-cacert> -tls_cert=<path-to-server-cert> -tls_key=<path-to-tls-key>
In future version we would support "Mozilla NSSDB" where cert nick name and mozdb dir is specified 

5. Configure overlay properly or meta directory ?

6. Rewrite everything in perl ? (to look more enterprisey ?)  

7. The more broader is to configure openldap that can be used to store kerberos tickets, dns, dhcp, samba ? (more like what ipa does)
